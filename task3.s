       ;       write a program that reverses the bit sequence stored in r8
       ;       in the example below, r8 stores 0b00000000 00000000 00000000 01100111
       ;       after running your program, r8 should be changed to 0b11100110 00000000 00000000 00000000
       ;       your program should work for any data in r8
       ;       the final result must be stored in r8
