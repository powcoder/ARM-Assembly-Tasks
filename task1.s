       ;       Write a program that calculates the sum of values stored in data.
       ;       Each value is 32-bits long, 0x0 is always the last element stored.
       ;       Note that the number of values in data is not fixed.
       ;       the result MUST be stored in register r8.
       ;       An example "data" definition is used below, your program should work on different data definitions.

data   DCD     0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x0
